                <p>The map is currently under construction, and therefore certain text and features are for testing purposes only. Enjoy at your own risk!</p>
                <h2>Release Date</h2>
                The map's anticipated release date is Memorial Day 2015, and will then be available at <strong>sbhtmap.org</strong> and via links from the Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore and Friends of Sleeping Bear Dunes websites.
                <h2>Seasons Tip</h2>
                While the map appears initially with only a handful of features, there is a LOT more than meets the eye, especially when the "Seasons" buttons are used. You are encouraged to select Winter, then click just about anywhere on the trail to see what that spot looks like during that season.
